# Assignment 03

This assignment is due Thursday, the 18th of February.

All of your submitted code should be contained in the file
MySolution/assign03_sol.dats. Here is an example of such a file:

https://github.com/hwxi/CS520-2021-Spring/blob/main/assigns/assign03/Solution/assign03_sol.dats

Before submitting, please make sure that you have a README.md in
your MySolution directory, which (very) briefly describes what you
have done for this assignment. In particular, you should state clearly
that what is submitted by you is YOUR OWN CODE. If there is collaboration,
you should clearly state it as well.

Before submitting, please make sure that you have the
following-like file in your MySolution directory which contains
some [output](./Solution/assign03_test.output) from testing your code:

https://github.com/hwxi/CS520-2021-Spring/blob/main/assigns/assign03/Solution/assign03_test.output

For instance, I generated my assign03_test.output by executing the following
command-line in MySolution directory:

```
make -C ../Solution all > assign03_test.output 2>&1
```
