# Assignment 00

## Task 1 (10 points)

Please create a private repository that mirrors this one and update
frequently. Your private repository should be named as following

https://github.com/hwxi/CS520-2021-Spring-USERID

where USERID refers to your BU user id. For instance, mine is hwxi
(and my bu email address is hwxi@bu.edu). Please note that USERID is
NOT your BU identification number (which is U followed by 8 digits).

## Task 2 (10 bonus points)

Installing ATS on your own laptop computer. You can find information
on installing ATS [here](http://www.ats-lang.org). Feel free to post
related questions on the class Piazza page.
