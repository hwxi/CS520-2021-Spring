Lists are EAGER. And streams are LAZY.

A stream is a lazy-value,
which is a THUNK (that is, a nullary closure function)

(*
datatype mylist(a:t@ype) = ...
*)

datatype
stream_con(a:t@ype) =
| stream_nil of ()
| stream_cons of (a, stream(a))

where
stream(a:t@ype) = lazy(stream_con(a))

This is a FUNCTIONAL stream, which is recorded.
