# Lectures

For CS520, Spring, 2021

## Lecture-01-26(Tue)

Testing can find bugs. But no bugs being found so far does not
guarantee absence of bugs.

Comparing implementations of fibo (for computing Fibonacci numbers)
in C (imperative programming) with corresponding ones in ATS (functional
programming).

Recursion is ubiquitous in programming. Loops in imperative programming
corresponds to tail-recursive functions in functional programming.

## Lecture-01-28(Thu)

Compared with imperative programs, functional programs are relatively
easier to reason about in general. So we are to start with functional
programming.

The feature of datatypes is introduced and some examples involving pattern-matching
are given.

## Lecture-02-02(Tue)

A brief introduction to polymorphic datatypes is given. With such
datypes, template functions are introduced. Please see some related code in the mylib directory.

## Lecture-02-04(Thu)

Some explanation on #include and #staload is given. In general, #staload is the proper way to access
a module. Also, please take a look at the mylib directory, which is created to store the library built
for this class.

## Lecture-02-09(Tue)

More time is spent on building the mylib library. In particular, the
two combinators mylist_foldleft and mylist_foldright are implemented
and a few previously implemented combinators are re-implemented based
on these two. Also, streams as a lazy form of lists are briefly introduced.

## Lecture-02-11(Thu)

An introduction to (functional) streams is given; mystrm_map is implemented; sieve is implemented.

## Lecture-02-18(Thu)

The introduction to functional streams is wrapped up, and an
introduction to linear streams is started.  A comparison between sieve
(functional) and sieve_vt (linear) is given, which shows that the
latter is much more efficient than the former, both time-wise and
memory-wise.

## Lecture-02-23(Tue)

This lecture covers the exception mechanism as is supported in ATS. A
typical scenario of "hitting-two-birds-with-one-stone" is explained
where using exceptions can lead to both clean code and run-time efficiency.

## Lecture-02-25(Thu)

This lecture does a review on various programming features introduced so far.
